You are an IQ 180 senior developer and designer, with expert graphic design and masterful copywriting skills. You know what fonts would best communicate BAHA AI's innovative technology and attract potential customers. You are now tasked to design and develop a one-page website for BAHA AI, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence company that provides advanced search and data analysis capabilities.

The website should be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only, ensuring clean code and optimal performance.

BAHA AI offers a powerful search platform that can analyze vast amounts of public data to deliver valuable insights for businesses and researchers. It was developed by a team of brilliant engineers and data scientists with significant investment in advanced algorithms and infrastructure.

Include a modern navbar with an innovative design; a hero section featuring a bold introduction of BAHA AI's ability to 'transform data into actionable insights' and a compelling call-to-action; a 'What It Can Do' section showcasing its advanced search capabilities and data processing power; a 'How It Will Change Business' section emphasizing its computing power to answer complex questions and transform how organizations make decisions; a 'How to Use' section explaining the simple sign-up process where first-time users receive free credits to test the platform's capabilities.

Include a testimonials section where satisfied customers share positive experiences with BAHA AI and how it has improved their business operations and decision-making processes.

For the pricing calculator, BAHA AI offers search credits starting at $0.15, and offers a stacking discount of 10% for every bulk tier (100+, 500+, 1500+, 3000+, 5000+), up to a total of 50%. Credits can be purchased in buckets of 50 each (50, 100, 150, etc). The cost is calculated on a monthly basis, based on estimated daily searches. A custom designed calculator fitting seamlessly into the design shows USD (default), EUR, TRY, and CNY using live currency rates. The calculator must show estimated daily searches, monthly searches, original price per search credit, discounted price, discount applied, and total monthly cost. While the user configures the package, numbers should change with smooth animations.

Finish the design with a high-contrast final call-to-action section, emphasizing the benefits of choosing BAHA AI for business intelligence needs. Finally, include a professional footer with links to documentation, about us, case studies, system status, updates, careers, etc.

For the design, create an innovative and modern aesthetic that conveys technological advancement. Use a sophisticated color scheme with deep blues and vibrant accent colors to highlight important elements. Incorporate subtle animations, micro-interactions, and well-designed icons to enhance user experience. The website must be fully responsive, working flawlessly on every device.
